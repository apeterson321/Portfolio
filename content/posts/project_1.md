* This project aimed to help a Girl Scout troop maximize their cookie sales by identifying the best NYC subway stations for their operation.
* The selection was based on the MTA turnstile subway data and Statistical Atlasâ€™s Census data, focusing on stations with high foot traffic near family-oriented neighborhoods.
* Subway stations were chosen as the selling points due to their high foot traffic, and stations near family-dense areas were assumed to yield higher sales.
* The project assumed that individuals with families living in residential neighborhoods would be the most likely to buy Girl Scout cookies.
* The data was filtered to consider only the hours after 3pm, considering that Girl Scouts are typically in school during the day and this is a high-traffic timeframe.
* High traffic areas like Manhattan neighborhoods were assumed to be less optimal due to the busy schedules of kids and parents.
* The project used 12 weeks of MTA turnstile data from the most recent three months (Dec 2021- March 2022), focusing on daily exits per station after 3pm.
* The Statistical Atlas Census data showed that neighborhoods with the highest percentage of family households were located in four clusters: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Corona.
* The top 50 stations by total daily turnstile exits and the family-dense neighborhoods were mapped on Google Earth.
* Based on the mapping, the top stations per borough cluster were determined, providing the Girl Scout troop with the best locations for their cookie sales operation.
