## Welcome to my website!

My name is Avery, and I'm an aspiring Data Scientist. I've been working in Data Science for almost two years, and I built this website to showcase my work. Professionally, I work in the financial services industry and focus primarily on our crypto products. My goal is to pivot into a more technically focused role and apply my data science knowledge.

In my freetime, I'm either hiking, camping, reading, or exploring new places. I'm a huge basketball fan (go Clippers!), and I'm always looking for opportunities to learn and grow.
